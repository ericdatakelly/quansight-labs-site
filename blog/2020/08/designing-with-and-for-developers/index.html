<p>Open source is notorious for lack of design presence, enough so that my search
to prove this fact has turned up nearly nothing. There’s many ways that such a
gap in community might manifest, but one that I never anticipated was working
with developers that had never interacted with a designer before.</p>
<p>A quick note for context: I’m writing this as a UX/UI designer working with
open source projects for a little over a year. Because there are so many ways
design processes can happen (enough to warrant its own blog post), this post is
not intended to discuss design process deeply. My goal here is to pass on some
of what I’ve learned that helps me design in this unusual space in hopes that
it can help someone else. This post might seem most relevant for designers, but
I think this experience could be helpful for developers as well.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>After a few years at more conventional design jobs where the workflow never
allowed me to communicate with our team’s developers, I started working with
Project Jupyter on JupyterLab. This was my first experience working
collaboratively with developers. I was feeling lost enough trying to comprehend
the scope of the software I was helping design, and the enigma of the
near-silent developer I began working with was not helping my nerves.</p>
<p>But it would be okay, because I had a plan! Surely if I set a good tone for
this relationship and asked how design was most helpful for them, they’d be
able to give me an answer, right? Here’s how that conversation went:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Hey, I’ve never gotten to work directly with a developer like this
before. How can I best support you? What are your expectations for working
with designers?</p>
<p>Developer: I’ve never worked with a designer, so I have no idea. Let me know
if I can help you, though.</p>
<p>Me: Oh, okay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We didn’t speak for the rest of the day. Not the overwhelming success story I
was looking for.</p>
<p>Once I learned I shouldn’t expect that everyone on my team to knows what they
want from the design process, here’s what helped me move forward and
collaborate with developers successfully.</p>
<h3>Say hello.</h3>
<p>Developers are the more established group in open source communities and may
not feel the pressure to adjust their workflow to bring in designers even if
they know it might benefit the project. Being on the outside, I’ve found it can
be easier for designers to be the ones to reach out and intervene where they
see a need for design. Just be friendly and be sure to give specific examples
of the kind of work you’d like to do while listening to what they want.
(Getting support from developers, however, is crucial, so if developers want to
be the ones to invite designers, it can be a big help.)</p>
<h3>Explore what’s already there.</h3>
<p>Whether there is a product that’s already been developed or it’s brand new, I
believe there’s always information that can be helpful in orienting a designer
in a project. Make sure to explore the product not just in the ways I find
designers are used to (testing the product based on use cases, heuristic
evaluation, competitive analysis, etc.), but in the ways developers might
experience or encounter it. This could be looking for what kinds of questions
people are frequently asking on Stack Overflow, issues on GitHub, or any other
kinds of documentation. One of the most helpful things is to have a grasp on
what words developers use to describe specific parts or experiences in the
project to make sure you are communicating with each other effectively.</p>
<h3>Trust your process.</h3>
<p>I hated being told this as a student, so hear me out before you immediately
close this blog post like I would have a year ago. Sometimes it really is best
to just start working with the intention of stepping back to evaluate the work
early, often, and with others before getting too wrapped up in your own
thoughts. I’ve found that once a developer has seen the direction I’m heading,
they often start to get concrete ideas about what kind of design information
they might need to turn those mockups and prototypes into real products. This
opens up the possibility for more informed and stronger design work delivered
in a way that makes everyone’s job easier.</p>
<h3>Talk to each other.</h3>
<p>This sounds obvious, but I find it easy to overlook by accident when both the
developer(s) and I start getting wrapped up in our own work. Ask them their
expectations about an interaction you are working on (developers are users,
too) or what kinds of technical limitations you should be aware of. If you
create a habit of bouncing ideas off one another, you’ll understand each other
better when solving harder problems and will feel more comfortable sharing
honest feedback. For me, this has been especially helpful since I work with
projects that draw users with specific technical knowledge, so I’m unlikely to
understand the user’s workflow deeply without relying on a little research.</p>
<h3>Check in.</h3>
<p>Would this kind of information be helpful when developing? Is this the work you
were expecting from me? Do you see anything missing from the design? Am I
representing this technical concept accurately? These are some of the typical
check-in questions I ask developers I work with when reaching check points in a
project. This regular feedback aided my development of a stronger workflow
designed to help developers get the work they needed to move forward. Like any
project, I find it critical to check in throughout working and at the end in
order to learn from the experience and make sure I’m cultivating a positive
relationship between design and development teams.</p>
<p>All these recommendations have grown and changed as the problems I face do the
same, and I’m sure they will continue to develop as I work with different
people and projects. In previous jobs, I had learned how to prove that my work
had value and that design is critical to a company’s success. I always had to
convince people to listen. Suddenly I’ve had people who are open to listening,
but had absolutely no idea who I was, what I did, or how I could help them. The
real problem began when I realized that I didn’t have confidence in my answers
to those questions, either.</p>
<p>At just over a year into designing for open source, I remain surprised that
this is more common than I thought. Across multiple projects and on different
teams, I’ve worked with several experienced developers that aren’t certain what
it means for me to be a UX/UI designer. It’s exciting in a unique way, and I’m
grateful that I’ve met friendly and curious people who want to collaborate in
spite of any uncertainty.</p>
<p>Most of all, I hope this helps someone looking for thoughts on navigating what
it’s like to work in open source from the standpoint of a non-developer. Thank
you for reading, and best of luck on your own collaborative adventures!</p>
