<p>Yesterday the SciPy'19 conference ended. It was a lot of fun, and very productive. You can really feel that there's a lot of energy in the community, and that it's growing and maturing. This post is just a quick update to summarize Quansight's presence and contributions, as well as some of the more interesting things I noticed.</p>
<h3>A few highlights</h3>
<p>The "Open Source Communities" track, which had a strong emphasis on topics like burnout, diversity and sustainability, as well as the keynotes by Stuart Geiger ("<em>The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software</em>") and Carol Willing ("<em>Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery</em>") showed that many more people and projects are paying more attention to and evolving their thinking on the human and organizational aspects of open source. </p>
<p>I did not go to many technical talks, but did make sure to catch Matt Rocklin's talk "<em>Refactoring the SciPy Ecosystem for Heterogeneous Computing</em>". Matt clearly explained some key issues and opportunities around the state of array computing libraries in Python - I highly recommend watching this talk.</p>
<p>Abigail Cabunoc Mayes' talk "<em>Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO) for Sustainability</em>" was fascinating - it made me rethink the governance models and roles we use for our projects, and I worked on some of her concrete suggestions during the sprints.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Finally, the number of people interested in helping grow the community and projects was a highlight. In my own talk I identified a number of things that we (the NumPy project) were not doing well or not doing at all, and for literally every single concrete item or action I mentioned I had one or more people come up to me to volunteer their time and expertise. So I'll definitely be sticking my hand up with a "we could really use some help here" more often in the coming months.</p>
<h3>Contributions by Quansight people</h3>
<p><strong>Carol Willing</strong> gave a fascinating keynote, <em>Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Anthony Scopatz</strong> must have lost out on some sleep: he gave a talk, <em>Inequality of Underrepresented Groups in Core Project Leadership</em>, co-taught two tutorials, <em>Xonsh - Bringing Python Data Science to your Shell</em> and <em>RAPIDS: Open GPU Data Science</em>, and entertailed us hosting the lightning talks every day (together with Paul Ivanov).</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Meurer</strong> taught the RAPIDS tutorial with Anthony, and co-organized a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session about SymPy.</p>
<p>I gave a talk, <em>Inside NumPy: Preparing for the Next Decade</em> and co-organized and moderated a BoF: <em>Mechanisms and Governance Issues for Funding Open Source Software in Science</em> (a lot of ideas to follow up on from that!).</p>
<p><strong>Chris Ostrouchov</strong>, <strong>Travis Oliphant</strong>, and <strong>Ivan Ogasawara</strong> gave lightning talks (I may be forgetting someone here, it was impossible to keep track of everything that was going on). <strong>James Bourbeau</strong> and <strong>Dharhas Pothina</strong> were also present; all of us stayed for the sprints, where we did everything from helping new people make their first open source contributions to in-depth design discussions, code review, and sketching out how the organizational structure of NumPy should be transformed.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you at SciPy'20 next year!</p>
