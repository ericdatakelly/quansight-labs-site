&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be honest with you, I started asking accessibility questions
in JupyterLab spaces while filled with anxiety. Anxiety that I was shouting
into the void and no one else would work on accessibility with me. Anxiety
that I didn’t have the skills or energy or knowledge to back up what I
wanted to do. Anxiety that I was going to do it wrong and make JupyterLab
even more inaccessible. Sometimes I still feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I've been part of a group of people in the JupyterLab community 
who've committed to start chipping away at the many accessibility failings of JupyterLab. 
I find this work is critical, fascinating, and a learning experience for everyone involved. 
So I'm going to document my personal experience and lessons I've learned in a series of blog 
posts. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

to prove this fact has turned up nearly nothing. There’s many ways that such a
gap in community might manifest, but one that I never anticipated was working
with developers that had never interacted with a designer before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note for context: I’m writing this as a UX/UI designer working with
open source projects for a little over a year. Because there are so many ways
design processes can happen (enough to warrant its own blog post), this post is
not intended to discuss design process deeply. My goal here is to pass on some
of what I’ve learned that helps me design in this unusual space in hopes that
it can help someone else. This post might seem most relevant for designers, but
I think this experience could be helpful for developers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
