&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Spyder 5 was released at the beginning of April! This 
blog post is a conversation attempting to document the long and complex 
process of improving Spyder's UI with this release. Portions lead by Juanita 
Gomez are marked as &lt;strong&gt;Juanita&lt;/strong&gt;, and those lead by Isabela Presedo-Floyd are 
marked as &lt;strong&gt;Isabela&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did we do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Juanita]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/"&gt;Spyder&lt;/a&gt; was created more than 10 
years ago and it has had the contributions of a great number of developers 
who have written code, proposed ideas, opened issues and tested PRs in order 
to build a piece of Spyder on their own. We (the Spyder team) have been lucky 
to have such a great community of people contributing throughout the years, 
but this is the first time that we decided to ask for help from an UX/UI 
expert! Why? You might wonder. Having the contributions of this great amount 
of people has resulted in inconsistencies around Spyder’s interface which we 
didn’t stop to analyze until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Isabela joined Quansight, we realized that we had an opportunity of 
improving Spyder’s interface with her help. We thought her skill set was 
everything we needed to make Spyder’s UI better.  So we started by reviewing 
the results of a community survey from a few months ago and realized that 
some of the most common feedback from users is related to its interface 
(very crowded, not consistent, many colors). This is why we decided to start 
a joint project with Isabela, (who we consider now part of the Spyder team) 
called &lt;a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v5.0.0"&gt;Spyder 5&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

involving more users in the community and making Spyder useful for a larger
number of people. With this, a new idea came: Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past months, we have been wondering with the team whether Spyder
could also serve as a teaching-learning platform, especially in this era
where remote instruction has become necessary. We submitted a proposal to the
Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program of the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative, during its third cycle, with the idea of providing a
simple way inside Spyder to create and share interactive tutorials on topics
relevant to scientific research. Unfortunately, we didn’t get this funding,
but we didn’t let this great idea die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We submitted a second proposal to the &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
from which we were awarded $4000. For me, this is the perfect opportunity for
us to take the first step towards using Spyder for education.&lt;/p&gt;

Six months ago I started a project with &lt;a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach"&gt;CAM Gerlach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ccordoba12"&gt;Carlos Cordoba&lt;/a&gt; to improve Spyder’s documentation. At first, I didn’t actually understand how important docs are for software, especially for open source projects. However, during all this time I’ve learned how documentation has a huge impact on the open-source community and I’ve been thankful to have been able to do this. But, from the beginning, I asked myself “why am I the ‘right person’ for this?”&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to wait until now to write a blogpost about it because shortly after the initial release, we found several critical performance issues and some regressions with respect to Spyder 3, most of which are fixed now in &lt;a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v4.1.2"&gt;version 4.1.2&lt;/a&gt;, released on April 3rd 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

The new 0.3.0 version adds numerous features that improves the user experience, and enhances compatibility with the latest Spyder 4 release, in part thanks to the improvements made in the &lt;a href="https://xtermjs.org/"&gt;xterm.js&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, we will be talking about the improvements made to the Variable Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the brand new Object Explorer for inspecting arbitrary Python variables, full support for MultiIndex dataframes with multiple dimensions, and the ability to filter and search for variables by name and type, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to mention that several of the above improvements were made possible through integrating the work of two other projects. Code from &lt;a href="https://github.com/TabViewer/gtabview"&gt;gtabview&lt;/a&gt; was used to implement the multi-dimensional Pandas indexes, while &lt;a href="https://github.com/titusjan/objbrowser"&gt;objbrowser&lt;/a&gt; was the foundation of the new Object Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been in the making for well over two years, and it contains lots of interesting new features. We will focus on the Files pane in this post, where we've made several improvements to the interface and file management tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simplified interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to simplify the Files pane's interface, the columns corresponding to size and kind are hidden by default. To change which columns are shown, use the top-right pane menu or right-click the header directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pane Menu" src="https://labs.quansight.org/images/spyder-files/pane-menu.png"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our next release, we are proud to announce an additional completion client for Spyder, Kite. &lt;a href="https://kite.com/"&gt;Kite&lt;/a&gt; is a novel completion client that uses Machine Learning techniques to find and predict the best autocompletion for a given text. Additionally, it collects improved documentation for compiled packages, i.e., Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy that cannot be obtained easily by using traditional code analysis packages such as Jedi.&lt;/p&gt;

This will enable the development of some features that have been requested by
our users, as well as new features that will help TDK develop custom Spyder
plugins in order to complement their Automatic Test Equipment (ATE’s) in the
development of their Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC’s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it may be useful to clarify the relationship the role of
Quansight Labs in Spyder's development and the relationship with TDK. To quote
Ralf Gommers (director of Quansight Labs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're an R&amp;amp;D lab for open source development of core technologies around data
science and scientific computing in Python. And focused on growing communities
around those technologies. That's how I see it for Spyder as well: Quansight
Labs enables developers to be employed to work on Spyder, and helps with
connecting them to developers of other projects in similar situations. Labs
should be an enabler to let the Spyder project, its community and individual
developers grow. And Labs provides mechanisms to attract and coordinate
funding. Of course the project is still independent. If there are other
funding sources, e.g. donations from individuals to Spyder via OpenCollective,
all the better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Projects aka Workspaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its current state Spyder can only handle one active project at a time.
Although in the past we had basic support for workspaces, it was never a fully
functional feature, so to ease development and simplify the user experience,
we decided to remove it in the 3.x series.&lt;/p&gt;

working on Spyder maintenance and 
development. So far, it has been a very exciting and rewarding journey under 
the guidance of long time Spyder maintainer
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ccordoba12"&gt;Carlos Córdoba&lt;/a&gt;.
This is the first of a series of blog posts we will be writing to showcase 
updates on the development of Spyder, new planned features and news on the 
road to Spyder 4.0 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I would like to give a warm welcome to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/andfoy"&gt;Edgar Margffoy&lt;/a&gt;,
who recently joined Quansight and will be working with the Spyder team to
take its development even further. Edgar has been a core Spyder developer 
for more than two years now, and we are very excited to have his (almost)
full-time commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spyder 4.0 Beta 2 released!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since August 2018, when the first beta of the 4.x series was released, the
Spyder development team has been working hard on our next release.
Over the past year, we've implemented the long awaited full-interface dark theme;
overhauled our entire code completion and linting architecture to use the
&lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/"&gt;Language Server Protocol&lt;/a&gt;,
opening the door to supporting many other languages in the future;
added a new Plots pane to view and manage the figures generated by your code;
and numerous other feature enhancements, bug fixes and internal improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dark theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full-interface dark theme has been a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/2350"&gt;long awaited feature&lt;/a&gt;,
and is enabled by default in Spyder 4. You can still select the
light theme under  &lt;code&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Appearance&lt;/code&gt; by either choosing a light-background
syntax-highlighting scheme, or changing &lt;code&gt;Interface theme&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Light&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Spyder main window with default panes, with the dark theme applied across the entire interface" src="https://labs.quansight.org/images/spyder-qdarkstyle.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty, right :-) ?&lt;/p&gt;
