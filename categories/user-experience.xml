Portions lead by Tim George are marked with
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;TG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and those lead by Isabela Presedo-Floyd are marked with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IPF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TG:&lt;/strong&gt; When I speak with other designers, one common theme I see concerning why
they chose this career path is they want to make a difference in the world. We
design because we imagine a better world and we want to help make it real. Part
of the reason we design as a career is we're unable to go through life without
designing; we're always thinking about how things are and how they could be
better. This ethos also exists in many open-source communities. It seems like it
ought to be an ideal match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the disconnect? I'm still exploring that myself, but after a few years
in open source I want to share my observations, experiences, and hope for a
stronger collaboration between design and development. I don't think I have a
complete solution, and some days I'm not even sure I grasp the entire problem.
What I hope is to say that which often goes unsaid in these spaces: design and
development skills in open source coexist precariously.&lt;/p&gt;
