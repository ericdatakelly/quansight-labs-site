name at the time. Even if notebooks were not invented by Jupyter; they were
definitely democratized by it. Being Web powered allowed development of many
changes in the Datascience world. Objects now often expose rich representation; from
Pandas dataframes with as html tables, to more recent &lt;a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14180"&gt;Scikit-learn model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to look into a topic that has not evolved much since, and I believe
could use an upgrade. Accessing interactive Documentation when in a Jupyter
session, and what it could become. At the end I'll link to my current prototype
if you are adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;

Six months ago I started a project with &lt;a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach"&gt;CAM Gerlach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ccordoba12"&gt;Carlos Cordoba&lt;/a&gt; to improve Spyder’s documentation. At first, I didn’t actually understand how important docs are for software, especially for open source projects. However, during all this time I’ve learned how documentation has a huge impact on the open-source community and I’ve been thankful to have been able to do this. But, from the beginning, I asked myself “why am I the ‘right person’ for this?”&lt;/p&gt;
