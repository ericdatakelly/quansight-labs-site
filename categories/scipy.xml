&lt;p&gt;SciPy's ndimage module provides a powerful set of general, n-dimensional image processing operations, categorized into areas such as filtering, interpolation and morphology. Traditional image processing deals with 2D arrays of pixels, possibly with an additional array dimension of size 3 or 4 to represent color channel and transparency information. However, there are many scientific applications where we may want to work with more general arrays such as the 3D volumetric images produced by medical imaging methods like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biological imaging approaches such as light sheet microscopy. Aside from spatial axes, such data may have additional axes representing other quantities such as time, color, spectral frequency or different contrasts. Functions in ndimage have been implemented in a general n-dimensional manner so that they can be applied across 2D, 3D or more dimensions. A more detailed overview of the module is available in the
&lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/ndimage.html"&gt;SciPy ndimage tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. SciPy's image functions are also used by downstream libraries such as &lt;a href="https://scikit-image.org"&gt;scikit-image&lt;/a&gt; to implement higher-level algorithms for things like image restoration, segmentation and registration.&lt;/p&gt;

Our ideas page is up &lt;a href="https://uarray.org/en/latest/gsoc/2020/ideas.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, go take a look and see if you (or someone you know) is interested in participating, either as a student or as a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prasun Anand and Peter Bell and myself will be mentoring, and we plan to take a maximum of two students, unless more community mentors show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/unumpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/udiff/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt; already to qualify from prospective students, some even going as far as to begin the work described in the idea they plan to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're quite excited by the number of students who have shown an interest in participating, and we look forward to seeing excellent applications! What's more exciting, though, are some of the first contributions from people not currently at Quansight, in the true spirit of open-source software!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Big data</category><category>NumPy</category><category>SciPy</category><category>Tensors</category><category>uarray</category><guid>https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2020/03/uarray-gsoc-participation/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 12:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Planned architectural work for PyData/Sparse</title><link>https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2020/02/whats-next-for-pydatasparse/</link><dc:creator>Hameer Abbasi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What have we been doing so far? ü§î&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research üìö&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of behind the scenes work has been taking place on PyData/Sparse. Not so much in terms of code, more in terms of research and community/team building. I've more-or-less decided to use the structure and the research behind the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tensor-compiler/taco"&gt;Tensor Algebra Compiler&lt;/a&gt;, the work of Fredrik Kjolstad and his collaborators at MIT. üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To this end, I've read/watched the following talks and papers:&lt;/p&gt;

It was a lot of fun, and very productive. You can really feel that there's a lot of energy in the community, and that it's growing and maturing. This post is just a quick update to summarize Quansight's presence and contributions, as well as some of the more interesting things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A few highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Open Source Communities" track, which had a strong emphasis on topics like burnout, diversity and sustainability, as well as the keynotes by Stuart Geiger ("&lt;em&gt;The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software&lt;/em&gt;") and Carol Willing ("&lt;em&gt;Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery&lt;/em&gt;") showed that many more people and projects are paying more attention to and evolving their thinking on the human and organizational aspects of open source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not go to many technical talks, but did make sure to catch Matt Rocklin's talk "&lt;em&gt;Refactoring the SciPy Ecosystem for Heterogeneous Computing&lt;/em&gt;". Matt clearly explained some key issues and opportunities around the state of array computing libraries in Python - I highly recommend watching this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail Cabunoc Mayes' talk "&lt;em&gt;Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO) for Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;" was fascinating - it made me rethink the governance models and roles we use for our projects, and I worked on some of her concrete suggestions during the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
